This exploit uses the `afdko` tool from the Adobe Font Development Kit Open Source Tools [1]. It's a set of command-line tools for font editing. The vulnerability is that the tool does not validate user input properly, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system where the tool is run.

The exploit sends a request to the `/cgi-bin/afdko` endpoint with specific parameters that can be used to execute arbitrary commands on the server. Specifically, it appends a `command` parameter with the value `touch /tmp/exploited`, which will create an empty file in the temporary directory if the exploit is successful.

To test this exploit:
1. Host this HTML page on your web server (make sure to serve it with the correct Content-Type).
2. Open the page in a vulnerable browser and observe that a `/tmp/exploited` file is created on the server if the vulnerability exists.
3. If you want to test for the exploit without actually executing any commands, you can change `touch /tmp/exploited` to something like `echo 'Vulnerable' >> /dev/null`. This will output "Vulnerable" to `/dev/null`, which effectively tests for the vulnerability.

Please note that using this exploit to cause any sort of harm is illegal and unethical. It should only be used in a legal penetration testing environment with proper authorization.
